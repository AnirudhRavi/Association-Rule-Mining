**Program**: Frequent Pattern Growth and Apriori implemented in C using FP and Hash trees respectively

**Author**: Anirudh Ravi

**About**:

These programs are written in C. The algorithm makes use of FP and Hash Tree to calculate frequent item sets through either FP Growth or Apriori approach and then generates Assocation rules for these itemsets.

**Data Set**:

The Groceries data set contains 1 month (30 days) of real-world point-of-sale transaction data from a typical local grocery outlet. The data set contains 9835 transactions and the items are aggregated to 169 categories. The data set is provided for arules by Michael Hahsler, Kurt Hornik and Thomas Reutterer.
